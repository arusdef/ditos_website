Do you want to experiment in our Open Wetlab as artist, designer, biologist, or just because your are interested in this field? Join us! The Open Wetlab is open for visitors every Tuesday. After a summer break the biolab of Waag Society is open again for everyone interested in creating and executing open source biology and technology related projects. 

Examples of previous projects are: 
- 3D printing with bacteria 
- Colouring of textiles with pigmented bacteria 
- Making sculptures using Mycelium (fungus) 
- (Ongoing) development of open source lab devices now used in the world wide BioHack Academy 
- Using the cellulose biomaterial created by kombucha cultures as a paper or fabric

How it works 
Collaborative projects are developed during 4-week cycles on Tuesday evenings. The next cycle will start the 20th of September. Not able to make it the first evening? You are welcome to join in later.

Program
18:00 - 19:00 Door open; bring your own dinner 
19:00 - 19:15 Introduction 
19:15 - 21:15 Projects and experimentation 
21:15 - 21:45 Wrap up
