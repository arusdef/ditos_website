What use are hormones, to us, to others, to other species? What if you extract them yourself instead of leaving that to the pharmaceutical industry? What can you make? Cocktails, connections, corrections? 

In this second edition of DIY Human Enhancement Clinic, invited artists-researchers Mary Tsang and Špela Petrič will teach and tell you how and what for to isolate your own hormones, by extracting them from your urine. What can we then use these hormones for? Injecting them back into our bodies, or mixing them into a fancy cocktail? 

Mary Tsang and Špela Petrič will show us that hormones are not only influencing our own bodies. New ways of modifying our hormones also affects our relationships with the species around us, and these effects aren’t always as straightforward as you may think. With your own hormones in the test tube before you, we will open a discussion on human enhancement that us out of our human-centeredness.
