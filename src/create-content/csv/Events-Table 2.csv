ECSA;BioBlitz (Phase 1);A concerted effort to discover and record as many living things as possible within a set location over a limited time period (usually 24 to 36 hours). This type of biodiversity monitoring activity engages large local audiences and in addition to the scientific aims – species recording and discovery – also aims at increasing scientific literacy and education. We use this category here to describe activities called BioBlitz as well as other short-term environmental monitoring activities.;"The 2 BioBlitz events will not happen in phase 1.

Activities and results will be discussed in a roundtable setting and the participants will debate on possibilities, potentials and further development of citizen science.;In June we organized a Local Stakeholder Roundtable with representatives of Ministry of Education, Science and Sport, Ministry of Economic Development and Technology, and The Government Office for Development and European Cohesion Policy. Altogether, 7 people were present, including Jurij Krpan and Maja Sande from Kersnikova Institute who gave extensive presentation of our field of work, our ideas and international projects we are involved with, with special emphasis on DITOs. The representatives wanted to learn about our connections to companies in Slovenia and abroad and which public scientific institutions are involved in our programme. After hearing our presentations and answers, they invited us to express our needs for the future, where we see ourselves in the larger development strategy and what are our proposals for so-called “Centre of Science” project.

The gallery will be set-up as an doctor's office and waiting room where Charlotte will meet individuals and discuss with them topics related to cancer and her scientific research in the framework of an artistic project. Practically, her project involved collaborations with Prof. Hans Clevers and Dr Jarno Drost at the Hubrecht Institute where she grew her own tumour. The first step was to have a rectoscopy to collect a biopsy from her bowel. The epithelial tissue collected included a kind of stem cell specific to the bowels, which constantly regenerate. Getting a rectoscopy for the project involved numerous practical and ethical hurdles. Many institutions were uncomfortable with performing any kind of procedure on a (hopefully) healthy individual, and in the end she had to use a private clinic. Her rectal tissue was grown from the biopsy into ‘organdies’. This was essentially her bowels in a petri dish. To make the tissue cancerous there were 4 mutations that needed to be carried out on the cells - these mutations represent the progression from a normal cell into a cancerous one - the cell needs to undergo all of these changes before it becomes cancer. The mutations target the cells ability to regulate its replication. To check each mutation the cell DNA was sequenced. After these steps were been carried out the cell culture ""became"" cancer.

On Monday the 3rd of October, we got to know Mojca Založnik, an analyst at the Institute of Oncology in Ljubljana, who is exploring the phenomenology of clinical practices and Charlotte Jarvis that is at this time exhibiting at Kapelica Gallery, where she is confronting with her own in-vitro cancer tissue. Their thesis that the disease (cancer) is predominately mystified and “externally” determined was deliberated with Mojca Kumerdej, a sci-fi writer, philosopher and journalist.

At the forthcoming event, organized in collaboration with KUD Mreža / Alkatraz Gallery and City of Women Festival, we will host Laura Olalde (ARG) who will present her works and collaborations with scientists at her art projects “Dogmatic Introversion” and “E.painting”, which have been executed at the “final frontiers” of art & science. Most of Laura’s works are made collaboratively within a “Proteus” collective, which consists of artists, scientists, and social scientists. A member of the Proteus collective, Diego Ulises Ferreiro Ph.D. of Biochemistry, will take part in the talk via videoconference from Buenos Aires.

We are getting an insight into their projects and realizations that excite and drive them. We are addressing topics that are not for everyone. At the forcoming talk, we will address the topics of energy transition, environmental conflicts and activities of civil society in this field. Through new developments in the area of energy, we will look at the development of civil society, the involvment of science and biopolitics. The old energy paradigm of self-sustainability will be put in juxtaposition to the old energy paradigm that is based upon using natural resources to the level of destroying the environment. The talk will be led by Tomislav Tkalec, Ph.D (Focus - institute for co-natural development) that works in the field of political implications and development of the energy sector and decentralized supply of electrical energy, prof. Andrej A. Lukšič, Ph.D. (Faculty of Social Sciences) who is an expert in the field of political ecology, modern society and contemporary political theories, and Dejan Savič (Greenpeace).;Completed;16;10;2016;Discussion/cafe/screenings;14;35;Env/Public;Kersnikova Institute;18 + ;https://www.facebook.com/events/1222059797854176/;;;;Kersnikova Institute, Kersnikova ulica 4;1000;Ljubljana;3 hours;KI_20161117;Reporting Period 1 (M1 - M15);Scoping (M1-M6);;;

At this event we hosted Urs Gaudenz, the founder of GaudiLabs and a pioneer in the field of DIY laboratory equipment. The talk was oriented towards DIY labs, DNA mapping, sequencing and multiplying, and it was held just after the conclusion of a 2-day workshop on this topic. The conversations revolved around applicative value of DIY equipment and the implications of using scientific equipment outside the frameworks of science / research institutions. Other speakers were Kristijan Tkalec, a biotechnologist and coordinator of our BioTehna Lab, and Boštjan Vihar, a biomimicrist and founder of a laboratory for biological and biomedical research at Irnas Institute. Our “Maitre d’salle” was Mojca Kumerdej, a sci-fi writer, philosopher and journalist.

Citizen Science is the part of the scientific research that involves and encourage citizen participation in scientific projects, where technological tools and digital devices provide multiple possibilities for involvement. This encounter starts on Friday with an intense programme of talks and workshops for more professional audiences. On Saturday, there is a second workshops session for all audiences to encourage participation in Citizen Science. The encounter is organized by Ibercivis (IC Citizen Science Observatory in Spain) and Medialab-Prado (Department of Culture and Sports of the Madrid City Council), in conjunction with Obra Social ""la Caixa"" and the projects DITOs and RRI Tools.

UCL;Bio Playshop (Phase 2);Playshops are hands-on workshops characterised by playfulness as an inviting and disarming attitude to engage with topics/conceptions of science and technology. Participants take part in a series of playshops that build their confidence, skills, and knowledge as they progress through their engagement. The playshops invite participants to explore their surrounding environment in ways that are relevant to their everyday lives - first, by exploring their senses and then by experimenting with sensors. This exploration is then given material/artistic representation accompanied by reflective discussions that link their learning and experiences to the bigger context of social and environmental issues in their communities, country, and the EU. The material representations of people's relationship to their environment will be exhibited for a short period at UCL museums or community centres giving other people an opportunity to engage with this work and meet the artists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Engagement (M7-M24);;;
